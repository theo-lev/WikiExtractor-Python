# Polyglot Wikipedia Matrix Extractor (2020-2021)
This project is held at the University of Rennes 1, ISTIC, in Master 1 MIAGE during the year 2020-2021.

## Project context
This project is inspired by the project "Wikipedia Matrix" started last year by a group of M1 MIAGE (2019-2020). 

### What is the project « Polyglot Wikipedia Matrix Extractor » ?
Like the project "Wikipedia Matrix", the goal is to collect and extract Wikipedia's tables. 
These tables are on several Wikipedia pages retrieved by their url. The content of these tables will be returned 
in files using CSV format. Last year, the extractor have been realized in language Java. 
This year, the goal was to realized an other extractor which works in the same way but the language use is Python. 
Then, we will be able to compare the two extractors.

Wikipedia's pages were write in two language, HTML and Wikitext. Unlike the extractor "Wikipedia Matrix", 
this extractor read and analyze Wikipedia pages only in HTML format.
