Normally between zero and three, but there is theoretically no upper limit in unusual circumstances such as misfields, overthrows or lost balls. If the ball strikes a piece of the fielding team's discarded equipment such as hats, helmets etc., an automatic five run penalty is awarded against the fielding side to the striking batsman.","runners advancing, with possibility of one or more runners reaching home for a run."

Seam deliveries will also sometimes turn on the bounce.","breaking balls curve in the air; the curveball/slider/cut fastball away from the pitching-hand side, the sinker, splitter, and forkball unexpectedly dip downwards (as can a curveball; see 12–6 curveball), the rare screwball bends toward pitching-hand side, as will the increasingly common circle change, and the unpredictable knuckleball which relies on atmosphere and wind can literally move in any direction, and even may corkscrew on its way to the plate"

The term ""opposite field"" in baseball is equivalent to ""off side"", as it is the side of the baseball field in front of the batter as he faces the pitcher."
substitution,"injured players can be replaced for fielding and running, not bowling, batting or keeping wicket except in the case of concussion (Law 2)","players can be replaced in line-up for any reason; once removed they cannot return (except in certain youth leagues such as Little League which allow a ""courtesy runner"" for a pitcher, some recreational leagues and exhibition games, and in special rules such as designated hitter); baseball substitution rule was originally also only in case of injury; unlike cricket, the replacement could also bat"
