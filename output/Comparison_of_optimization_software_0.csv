A common interface for many different algorithmsâ€”try a different algorithm just by changing one parameter. Support for large-scale optimization (some algorithms scalable to millions of parameters and thousands of constraints). Both global and local optimization algorithms. Algorithms using function values only (derivative-free) and also algorithms exploiting user-supplied gradients. Algorithms for unconstrained optimization, bound-constrained optimization, and general nonlinear inequality/equality constraints.
