b,[b ~ β],[b ~ β] (EP) [b] (BP),In Spanish and European Portuguese /b/ is lenited after a continuant.
d,[d ~ ð],[d ~ ð] (EP) [d ~ dʒ] (BP),"In Spanish and European Portuguese /d/ is lenited after a continuant. In all Portuguese dialects, the consonants /t/ and /d/ have affricate allophones, happening when before a palatalizing /i/ ([dʒi ~ dʑi], [tʃi ~ tɕi], mainly in Brazil), or an elided /ɨ/ ~ /e̞/ ~ /ɪ/ or unstressed /i/ before another (that actually becomes /ɨ/ in Portugal), stressed one, leading to sandhi ([dVz] → [dz], [dVs] → [ts], [tVs] → [ts], both in Brazil and Portugal)."
t,[t],[t] (EP) [t ~ tʃ] (BP),"In Spanish and European Portuguese /d/ is lenited after a continuant. In all Portuguese dialects, the consonants /t/ and /d/ have affricate allophones, happening when before a palatalizing /i/ ([dʒi ~ dʑi], [tʃi ~ tɕi], mainly in Brazil), or an elided /ɨ/ ~ /e̞/ ~ /ɪ/ or unstressed /i/ before another (that actually becomes /ɨ/ in Portugal), stressed one, leading to sandhi ([dVz] → [dz], [dVs] → [ts], [tVs] → [ts], both in Brazil and Portugal)."
g,[ɡ ~ ɣ],[ɡ ~ ɣ] (EP) [ɡ] (BP),In Spanish and European Portuguese /ɡ/ is lenited after a continuant.
-l,[l],[ɫ] (EP) [w] (BP),"In European Portuguese syllable-final /l/ is velarized [ɫ] as in Catalan (see dark l), while in most Brazilian dialects and some rural European ones it is vocalized to [w]. Caipira rhoticizes to English-like ar, while portunhol da pampa velarizes it."
"r-, -rr-",[r],[ʁ],"In Portuguese, r- and -rr- have several possible pronunciations. In most dialects, it is a guttural r as in French ([ʀ], [ʁ] and [χ] in Portugal and Brazil, [x], [ɣ], [ħ], [h] and [ɦ] in Brazil), while in rural northern Portugal and southern Brazil it is a trilled r [r] (like in Galician). In some southern and western Brazilian dialects word final -r may be a tap (as in Portugal and Galicia), though English-like [ɹ], [ɻ] or [ɚ] is more common, while in northern and eastern dialects it is guttural. In Spanish, r- and -rr- have kept their original pronunciation as an alveolar trill [r]. Intervocalic -r- is an alveolar tap in both languages [ɾ]."
v,[b ~ β],[v],"Originally, the letters ⟨b⟩ and ⟨v⟩ stood for distinct sounds pronounced [b] and [β], respectively, but the two eventually merged into a single phoneme in Spanish. In most varieties of Portuguese they remained separate phonemes, and the bilabial fricative [β] of Old Portuguese subsequently changed into the labiodental fricative [v], as in French and Italian."
